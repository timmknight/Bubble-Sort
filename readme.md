Your Task
Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldn't it?).
    > bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
    => [0,2,2,3,4,78]
Now create a similar method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array but accepts a block. The block should take two arguments which represent the two elements currently being compared. Expect that the block's return will be similar to the spaceship operator you learned about before -- if the result of the block is negative, the element on the left is "smaller" than the element on the right. 0 means they are equal. A positive result means the left element is greater. Use this to sort your array.
    > bubble_sort_by(["hi","hello","hey"]) do |left,right|
    >   right.length - left.length
    > end
    => ["hi", "hey", "hello"]
